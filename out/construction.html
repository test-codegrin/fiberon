We can use GFRP Rebar at various places such as dockyards, dams, waterside walls, bridges on water, and many more. GFRP Rebar is helpful for marine structures.</p></div><div><h3>Strength</h3><p>GFRP Rebar is two times stronger than traditional steel bars. It increases the strength of construction. Stronger material increases the strength of construction. The foundation is the core of the construction. GFRP Rebar is an ideal choice for foundation and other construction. By strength, we can increase the strength of construction. It decreases maintenance and replacement costs.</p></div><div><h3>Lighter</h3><p>GFRP Rebar is ¼ lighter than traditional steel bars. GFRP Rebar provides much more strength at a lighter weight. GFRP Rebar is an ideal choice for construction. GFRP Rebar is a stronger and lighter material. The lighter property makes transportation easy. You can bend the rebar as per requirement. It saves transportation costs. The installation of the GFRP Rebar is easy because of its lightweight.</p></div><div><h3>Non-conductive:</h3><p>GFRP Rebar does not conduct electricity, which makes GFRP Rebar an ideal choice where electricity is concerned.</p></div><div><h3>Thermal Insulation:</h3><p>GFRP Rebar offers better thermal insulation properties than steel bars. This can benefit certain construction projects where minimizing thermal bridging is important.</p></div><div><h3>Durable:</h3><p>GFRP Rebar is a stronger, lighter material. GFRP Rebar makes the construction much stronger than steel bars. It is a lighter material. It increases the strength of construction. It is corrosion resistant material. It saves the construction from corrosion and rust. It reduces the maintenance and replacement costs.</p></div><div><h3>Cost:</h3><p>Cost is one of the core things in all the business. Cost can be calculated in various ways, such as cost price, recurring requirements of material, transportation of material cost, installation, and many more. GFRP Rebar is a bit high in cost as compared to steel bars, But it is cost-effective for longer use. GFRP Rebar provides two times strength, so it makes the construction stronger. GFRP Rebar is a corrosion-resistant material; It does not corrode and rust. It saves the cost of maintenance and replacement. GFRP Rebar is a lightweight material. You can easily bend this rebar, so the transportation of GFRP Rebar is very easy, and it also saves construction costs.</p></div><div><h3>High temperature:</h3><p>GFRP Rebar can handle high temperatures. It is an ideal choice for construction where the temperature is always high such as highways, nuclear stations, power stations, and many more. By using GFRP Rebar, we can decrease maintenance and replacement costs.</p></div><div><h3>Steel bars</h3><p>Steel bars are commonly referred to as steel reinforcement bars. It is a widely used material, But it has many disadvantages, such as corrosion, strength, high temperature, weight, electrical conductivity, and many more.</p><ol><li><b>Corrosion : </b><br/>One major drawback of steel bars is their susceptibility to corrosion when exposed to moisture, oxygen, and aggressive chemicals. Corrosion can lead the construction to collateral damages, causing cracking, sparkling, and many more. By using steel bars, construction requires regular maintenance and replacements.</li><li><b>Weight:</b><br/>Steel bars are heavyweight, which can complicate transportation, handling, and installation, especially when access is limited. High weight increases of material increases the weight of construction.</li><li><b>Electrical conductivity : </b><br/>Steel is highly conductive to electricity, posing safety risks in structures near power lines or electrical-sensitive environments.</li><li><b>Cost:</b><br/> Cost is one of the important things in all the businesses. The price of steel bars is low compared to GFRP Rebar, But steel bars have many disadvantages. By using steel bars, the construction requires various maintenance and replacement. It increases the maintenance and replacement costs. Steel bars are heavier as compared to GFRP Rebar. The transportation cost of steel bars is high.</li><li><b>Temperature:</b><br/>Materials selection is much more important where temperature is concerned, such as highways, Nuclear stations, power stations, and many more. Steel bars are not compatible with high temperatures. Using steel bars can create collateral damages, requiring regular maintenance and replacement.</li></ol><p>Durable: Steel bars are not durable materials. Steel bars are not corrosion-resistant material. By using steel bars, it weakens the construction. Steel bars can not handle the high temperature. It increases the maintenance and replacement costs.</p></div><div><h3>RCC</h3><p>RCC stands for Reinforced Concrete Cement. It is a widely used construction material and technique that combines concrete and steel bars.RCC is used in various construction applications, from buildings and bridges to dams and roads.<!-- --> </p></div><div><h3>Advantages Of RCC</h3><p>RCC stands for Reinforced Concrete Cement. It is a widely used construction material and technique that combines concrete and steel bars.RCC is used in various construction applications, from buildings and bridges to dams and roads.<!-- --> </p><ol><li><b>Strength: </b><br/>The combination of concrete’s strength and GFRP rebar’s tensile strength results in a material that can effectively withstand compressive and tensile stresses.</li><li><b>Versatility:</b><br/>We can use RCC with materials such as GFRP Rebar, Steel bars, FRP, and many more.</li><li><b>Durability:</b><br/>When designed and maintained properly, RCC structures have a long life span of construction.</li><li><b>Flexible:</b><br/>RCC is a flexible material. It can mold so that we can use RCC as per our requirements.</li></ol></div><h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">FIBERON Composite Rebar</h2><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">MRG Composite Rebar is <b>The Pioneer of GFRP Rebar in India</b> and a leading manufacturer and supplier worldwide.
