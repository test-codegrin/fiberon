            In Construction, “Non-Conductive” refers to materials or substances
            that do not conduct electricity. These materials are used in various
            applications to prevent the flow of electrical current, reducing the
            risk of electrical hazards and ensuring safety.

            In the ever-evolving world of Construction and infrastructure
            development, innovation and sustainability are the cornerstones of
            progress. GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) Rebar is at the
            forefront of this revolution, offering a wide range of advantages.
            One of its standout features is its non-conductive nature, which
            makes it an invaluable material in various applications where
            electrical conductivity is a concern.

            Glass Fiber Polymer Resin is a non-conductive material. It provides
            various properties which make it an ideal choice for Construction.
            Here’s why GFRP Rebar is a non-conductive material.

              Fibers embedded in the polymer resin matrix. Glass fibres are
              non-conductive, and the polymer matrix used in GFRP rebar
              formulations is also non-conductive. As a result, the GFRP rebar
              does not conduct electricity.
