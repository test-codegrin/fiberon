            What Are the Problems Caused by Heavy Construction Materials?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Construction has relied on heavy materials like steel and concrete
            for centuries. While these materials provide strength, they also
            pose several challenges:

            <li>
              <b>Excessive Load on Structures</b> <br /> Heavy materials
              increase the dead load of buildings, bridges, and other
              infrastructure. This additional weight places stress on
              foundations, requiring complex designs and increasing material
              usage.

            <li>
              <b>Higher Transportation Costs</b> <br /> Transporting heavy
              materials requires more fuel, larger vehicles, and multiple trips,
              driving up logistical expenses.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Slower Construction Processes</b>
              <br />
              Heavy materials demand specialized handling equipment, additional
              labor, and extended installation time, delaying project timelines.

            GFRP Rebar vs. Steel Rebar for Lightweight Construction
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            When it comes to lightweight construction, GFRP rebar outperforms
            traditional steel rebar in several critical areas. GFRP rebar is up
            to 75% lighter, making transportation, handling, and installation
            significantly easier and more cost-effective compared to steel,
            which is much heavier and requires specialized equipment. Unlike
            steel, GFRP rebar does not corrode, even in harsh environments such
            as marine or chemical-exposed areas, ensuring a longer lifespan and
            lower maintenance costs. Its high strength-to-weight ratio delivers
            excellent tensile strength without the burden of added weight, while
            its non-magnetic and non-conductive properties make it ideal for
            sensitive applications like MRI facilities or electrical
            substations. Additionally, GFRP rebar is more environmentally
            friendly, producing fewer carbon emissions during manufacturing and
            aligning with sustainable construction goals. By choosing GFRP
            rebar, contractors can achieve durable, efficient, and
            cost-effective solutions for modern construction projects,
            especially those requiring lightweight materials.
