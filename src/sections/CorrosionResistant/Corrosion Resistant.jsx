          In construction, corrosion is one of the most important factors that
          threaten the durability and safety of structures. Steel reinforcement
          bars get corroded and weaken the construction; it requires regular
          maintenance and, at times, construction replacement. Frequently,
          contractors and builders encounter difficulties selecting the
          reinforcement that will help to hold construction and withstand
          destructive influence.

          Corrosion is one of the crucial problems faced by many contractors and
          structures. Corrosion is a natural process where a particular metal is
          destroyed due to chemical reactions with the environment. Moisture,
          salts, and industrial pollutants accelerate this process and damage
          the construction. It majorly disturbs marine construction. For

            with many good properties such as corrosion resistance, strength,
            lightweight, <b className="text-[#347A63]">non-conductive</b>, etc. Using GFRP Rebar can
            decrease maintenance and construction replacement costs. At the same
            time, steel rebars are not compatible with water. Using steel rebar
            weakens the construction and increases maintenance and, at times,
            construction replacement costs. FIBERON-X Composites provides the best
