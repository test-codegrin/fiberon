          In construction, corrosion is one of the most important factors that
          threaten the durability and safety of structures. Steel reinforcement
          bars get corroded and weaken the construction; it requires regular
          maintenance and, at times, construction replacement. Frequently,
          contractors and builders encounter difficulties selecting the
          reinforcement that will help to hold construction and withstand
          destructive influence.

          Understanding Corrosion: The Problem Builders Face

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          Corrosion is one of the crucial problems faced by many contractors and
          structures. Corrosion is a natural process where a particular metal is
          destroyed due to chemical reactions with the environment. Moisture,
          salts, and industrial pollutants accelerate this process and damage
          the construction. It majorly disturbs marine construction. For
          contractors,

              The full form of GFRP Rebar is{" "}

                Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer

          Why GFRP Rebar for Corrosion Resistant Construction?

          <li>
            Complete Corrosion Resistance: Steel rebars begin to rust when they
            come in contact with moisture and oxygen. In contrast, GFRP Rebars
            are immune to corrosion. GFRP Rebar is embedded with glass fibre and
            polymer resin. It makes the construction more stronger that can
            withstand in harsh conditions.
          </li>

          <li>
            Lightweight and easy to install: GFRP Rebar is ¼ <b>lighter</b> than
            traditional steel bars. Transportation of GFRP rebars is very easy
            compared to steel rebars. It also reduces the installation process,
            time and labour cost.
          </li>

          <li>
            Cost-effective: GFRP bars are durable construction materials. By
            using GFRP Rebar, the construction does not require regular
            maintenance and construction replacement. It saves the cost. The
            lightweight property of GFRP Rebar makes transportation easy and
            saves additional money.
          </li>

          <li>
            Superior Strength: GFRP Rebar is twice as strong as traditional
            steel rebar. GFRP makes the construction more <b>stronger</b> at
            lighter weight.

            Applications of GFRP Rebars: Meeting Builder Requirements
          </h2>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <li>
              Marine Structures: Marine environments are amongst the most
              challenging for traditional construction materials because of
              constant exposure to saltwater, humidity, and high temperatures.
              Saltwater accelerates corrosion and weakens the construction.
            </li>

            <li>
              Industrial Plants: Industrial plants always deal with chemicals
              and other corrosive materials that can weaken the floors of
              industrial buildings. GFRP Rebars are an ideal choice for
              chemical, power, and other industrial plants.
            </li>

            <li>
              Bridges and highways: GFRP rebars prevent corrosion caused by
              de-icing salts, coastal humidity, and harsh environmental
              conditions. They are widely used in bridges, flyovers, and coastal
              highways to enhance lifespan and reduce repair costs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Water treatment plants: Wastewater treatment construction requires
              construction material that is resistant to moisture and chemicals,
              GFRP Rebar fullfill this requirement. Glass fibre polymer
              reinforced polymer ensures long-term durability.
            </li>

            <li>
              Tunnels and Underground Structures: Underground construction is
              most likely to be prone to moisture and aggressive soil conditions
              promoting steel rust.GFRP rebars are widely used in tunnel linings
              and underground storage tanks, offering a moisture-resistant
              solution that ensures safety and longevity.
            </li>

            <li>
              Residential and Commercial Buildings: In urban construction, GFRP
              rebars are used in foundations, parking garages, and rooftop
              pools. They eliminate corrosion risks from soil moisture, vehicle
              fluids, and pool chemicals, providing a long-lasting,
              cost-effective reinforcement solution.

            GFRP Rebar Vs Steel Rebar Cost
          </h2>

          <p>
            Many contractors use steel rebar for construction. There are many
            differences between steel rebar and GFRP rebar. GFRP Rebar comes
            with many good properties such as corrosion resistance, strength,
            lightweight, <b>non-conductive</b>, etc. Using GFRP Rebar can
            decrease maintenance and construction replacement costs. At the same
            time, steel rebars are not compatible with water. Using steel rebar
            weakens the construction and increases maintenance and, at times,
            construction replacement costs. MRG Composites provides the best
            <b>GFRP rebar price quality in India.</b>

            For contractors and builders looking to future-proof their projects,
            investing in <b>GFRP rebars</b> is a no-brainer. GFRP Rebar’s
