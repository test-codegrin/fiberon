                <br />
                The corrosive environment, primarily due to high humidity levels
                and constant exposure to de-icing salts, significantly
                deteriorated the road infrastructure. Traditional steel rebar
                rusted quickly and weakened structurally, which required
                frequent repairs and posed a safety risk.

                  Heavy Load Bearing Requirements:
                </span>
                <br />
                The National Highway requires reinforcement bars that can
                withstand heavy traffic loads, including commercial trucks and
                high-speed vehicles. GFRP Rebar completes high tensile strength
                while maintaining structural integrity over time.
